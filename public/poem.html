    <h1>Saint Francis and the Sow</h1>
    <p>A poem by Galway Kinnell</p>

    <p>
      The bud
      stands for all things,<br>
      even for those things that don't flower,<br>
      for everything flowers, from within, of self-blessing;<br>
      though sometimes it is necessary<br>
      to reteach a thing its loveliness,<br>
      to put a hand on its brow<br>
      of the flower<br>
      and retell it in words and in touch<br>
      it is lovely<br>
      until it flowers again from within, of self-blessing;<br>
      as Saint Francis<br>
      put his hand on the creased forehead<br>
      of the sow, and told her in words and in touch<br>
      blessings of earth on the sow, and the sow<br>
      began remembering all down her thick length,<br>
      from the earthen snout all the way<br>
      through the fodder and slops to the spiritual curl of the tail,<br>
      from the hard spininess spiked out from the spine<br>
      down through the great broken heart<br>
      to the sheer blue milken dreaminess spurting and shuddering<br>
      from the fourteen teats into the fourteen mouths sucking and blowing beneath them:<br>
      the long, perfect loveliness of sow.<br>
